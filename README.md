This repository contains the results and analysis of a survey I conducted to evaluate students' perceptions of the dining hall food at 
Western Illinois University (WIU). The study aimed to 1) See what students actually think about our dinning hall food and 2) Understand
whether students' negative feedback about campus food reflects genuine dissatisfaction or it's all just fluff. Results are represented
using tabling and graphing tools on excel, as well as some R code(Both are attached in this repository). I then sent my results to sudexo
representatives for actionable insights.
